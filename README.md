# CSM-1B Transformers Streaming Audio Generator

This repository contains a Python implementation for generating streaming audio with the transformers implementation of CSM-1B (Contrastive Speech Model) model. It provides efficient, real-time audio generation with detailed performance metrics.

## Features

- 🔊 Real-time streaming audio generation
- ⚡ Optimized for low latency with chunk-based generation
- 📊 Detailed performance metrics (RTF - Real-Time Factor)
- 🎭 Support for reference audio samples

## Installation

### Requirements
* A CUDA-compatible GPU
* The code has been tested on CUDA 12.8 and 12.6, but it may also work on other versions
* Similarly, Python 3.10 is recommended, but newer versions may be fine
* For some audio operations, `ffmpeg` may be required

```bash
git clone git@github.com:davidbrowne17/csm-streaming-tf.git
cd csm-streaming-tf
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Usage

### Loading the Model

```python
from generator import load_csm_1b

# Load the model from HuggingFace
generator = load_csm_1b("eustlb/csm-1b")
```

### Simple Text-to-Speech

```python
from generator import load_csm_1b, generate_streaming_audio

# Load the model
generator = load_csm_1b("eustlb/csm-1b")

# Generate audio from text
prompt = "The sunset painted the sky with hues of orange and purple."
audio = generate_streaming_audio(
    generator, 
    prompt, 
    output_filename="output.wav",
    play_audio=True
)
```

### Direct Streaming Generation

For more control over the generation process, you can use the streaming API directly:

```python
from generator import load_csm_1b, load_reference_audio
# Load the model from HuggingFace
generator = load_csm_1b("eustlb/csm-1b")
# Prepare reference audio data
reference_data = [
    {
        "path": "path/to/reference1.wav",
        "text": "This is a reference sample for voice cloning.",
        "speaker_id": "0"
    }
]

# Load the reference audio
refs = load_reference_audio(reference_data)

# Create conversation with reference audio
conversation = []
for ref in refs:
    conversation.append({
        "role": ref["speaker_id"],
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": ref["text"]},
            {"type": "audio", "audio": ref["audio_array"]}
        ]
    })

# Add the current prompt
conversation.append({
    "role": refs[0]["speaker_id"],
    "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Generate this text with the voice from the reference audio."}
    ]
})
inputs = generator.processor.apply_chat_template(
        conversation,
        tokenize=True,
        return_dict=True
    ).to(generator.device)
# Stream generation with custom handling
for i, chunk in enumerate(generator.generate_stream(inputs, chunk_token_size=20)):
    # chunk is a tensor containing audio samples
    # process or play each chunk as needed
    print(f"Generated chunk {i+1} with {len(chunk.cpu().numpy()) / 24000:.3f} seconds of audio")
```

### Using Reference Audio

```python
from generator import load_csm_1b, load_reference_audio, generate_streaming_audio

# Load the model
generator = load_csm_1b("eustlb/csm-1b")

# Prepare reference audio data
reference_data = [
    {
        "path": "path/to/reference1.wav",
        "text": "This is a reference sample for voice cloning.",
        "speaker_id": "0"
    }
]

# Load the reference audio
refs = load_reference_audio(reference_data)

# Create conversation with reference audio
conversation = []
for ref in refs:
    conversation.append({
        "role": ref["speaker_id"],
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": ref["text"]},
            {"type": "audio", "audio": ref["audio_array"]}
        ]
    })

# Add the current prompt
conversation.append({
    "role": refs[0]["speaker_id"],
    "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "Generate this text with the voice from the reference audio."}
    ]
})

# Generate audio
audio = generate_streaming_audio(
    generator,
    conversation,
    output_filename="with_reference.wav",
    play_audio=True
)
```

### Generator Class

generator = Generator(model, processor, device)
```

#### `generate_stream(inputs, chunk_token_size=20, **kwargs)`

- `synced_gpus`: Whether to sync across GPUs
- `chunk_token_size`: Number of codebook tokens to generate before yielding a chunk
- `**kwargs`: Additional arguments for generation

Yields:
- Raw audio chunks as PyTorch tensors in the range [-1, 1]

Details:
This method implements the core audio streaming functionality by:
1. Initializing RTF metrics tracking
2. Processing inputs and preparing the model
3. Running an initial forward pass
4. Entering the main generation loop:
   - Generate tokens for all codebooks
   - Check for EOS (end of sequence)
   - Accumulate tokens and yield audio chunks when `chunk_token_size` is reached
   - Decode audio using the codec model
   - Calculate and report RTF metrics
5. Providing comprehensive RTF metrics on completion

## Performance Metrics

The code automatically calculates and displays Real-Time Factor (RTF) metrics:

- RTF < 1.0: Generation is faster than real-time playback
- RTF = 1.0: Generation happens at exactly real-time
- RTF > 1.0: Generation is slower than real-time

The streaming implementation provides these metrics for each chunk and overall generation.

## FAQ

**How much faster is the streaming version?**

The perceived response time is significantly faster since you get the first audio chunks in milliseconds instead of waiting for the entire generation to complete. The actual total generation time is also improved by 40-60% depending on your hardware.

**Does this model come with any voices?**

The model is a base generation model capable of producing a variety of voices but hasn't been fine-tuned on any specific voice. Provide reference audio for best results.

**Can I converse with the model?**

CSM is trained to be an audio generation model and not a general-purpose multimodal LLM. It cannot generate text. Using a seperate LLM you can converse with the realtime demo via the web ui.

**Does it support other languages?**

The model has some capacity for non-English languages due to data contamination in the training data, but it likely won't do well.
